# Preproposal

## What idea(s) do you have for your final project?

In terms of my final Project, my idea is to import a dataset with a binary target variable and implement a machine learning algorithm that allows for prediction of said target variable for future observations. In regards to the machine learning algorithm, I want to experience working with random decision forests for classification purposes. 

## What can I 100% complete for this project?

I believe an acheivement that I will reach 100% regardless of the difficulty I have with the project is that I will be able to implement some form of a machine learning algorithm for a dataset. The goal I have set out is to work Randome decision forests, but I believe in worst case scenario I will be able to implement either a simple decision tree for classification purposes or linear regression algorithm for prediction. 

## If you plan to collaborate with one or two classmates, what are their names?

At the current moment, I do not have any plans of working with anybody else on this project

## Do you have any questions of your own?

A few questions I have to help me with this project is what resources would you recommend that I look into for gaining some familarity with random decision forests algorithm? Are there any datasets you recommend I check out for this project? Since the project will require me to look into some popular data science libraries such as pandas and numpy, how do you believe I should get started with those?
