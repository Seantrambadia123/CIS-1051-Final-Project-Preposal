# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Counterfeit Detector: Banknote edition

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

A model which can accurately predict if a banknote(euro dollar bill or us dollar) is authentic or not.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

As mentioned before my software is essentially responsible for detecting whether a banknote will be fraudulent or authentic on the basis of four variables (Variance of image, skewness, entropy, and Kurtosis). An essential feature for this software will be to take the given inputs by the user for the four variables, and have the program return whether the note is fradulent or not. This code will be executed with the help of many libraries and the implementation of a machine learning classifier algorithm. 

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

Not planning to combine the final project with that of another course, only possible reference of another course may be the fact that I am using a statistical application for a machine learning algorithm

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

Planning to work on my final project alone

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

I will have imported a dataset regarding the images of banknotes(euros and dollar bills) which have five variables such as Variance of image, Skewness, Kurtosis, Entropy, and the target variable (Authentic or Fraud). I will have utilized multiple functions with the packages of Pandas, Numpy, and Scikitlearn, and will have implemented atleast a logistic regression model for prediction of the target variable.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

With the amount of time given to complete this final project, I strongly believe I will be able to learn a new classification machine learning algorithm that will accurately help me predict the target variable for future observations. Bottom line is I believe I will be able to learn the inner workings of a classification algorithm I did not already know such as, Naive Bayes classifier, Random forests, or even Neural networks, and then implement this algorithm for a prediction model for my data. 

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

If I experience rapid success throughout the duration of my project, and I find myself being able to implement a new classification algorithm with ease. I hope that I will be able to implement multiple types of alogirthms to create multiple models and determine which is best at preiction. For example, implement a logistic regression algorithm for a certain model, implement a random forest classifier for another model, and implement a decision tree algorithm for the last model, and compare to see which model is most accurate.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

In terms of new skills I will need to acquire for this project is becoming comfortable with the syntax and methods for at least three new libraries including, Numpy, Pandas, and Scikitlearn. Additionally a few topics I would need to research is a random forest algorithm (or any classifier algorithm that my project ends up using). Some things I would research about the algorithm include diagnostics to test the efficiency of the model, exploratory data analysis to initialize any parametes for the algorithm, and etc.
